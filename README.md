## Project Architecture üèõÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏è
This project, in its current form, is divided into two main apps: Pages and Posts. Each app is responsible for its models, views, URLs, and test cases. 

'Pages' handles user logic, such as registering an account and logging in, and eventually profile functionality, like editing one's profile or viewing others. 

'Posts' handles creating posts, commenting, and liking/disliking posts. This app is centered around the main business logic of viewing and creating interactive posts. 

'social_media_app' is the main driver of this project where users can find the app's configuration in settings.py. This folder also contains URLs (urls.py) and custom forms (forms.py) used throughout both apps in the project.

### Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip - [Package Installer for Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Setup
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parkerallan/SDEV-435-81.git
cd SDEV-435-81
```
Configure your environment for 'development' on line 20 of settings.py:
```python
ENVIRONMENT = env('ENVIRONMENT', default='development')
```
Setup local environment with dependencies:
```python
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

# Install pip dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For admin access, run migrations and create a root user:
```python 
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Finally, run the application:
```python 
python manage.py runserver
```
### Running Test Suite üîçüß™
Test coverage for this app is provided through unit tests using Django's TestCase package
#### To run the tests from a development setup:
```python 
python manage.py test
```
For faster results and more information, use verbosity and parallel flags:
```python 
python manage.py test -v 2 --parallel 4
```
#### Alternatively, run the tests from the Django CI action on this page [here](https://github.com/parkerallan/SDEV-435-81/actions/workflows/django.yml), next, click the 'Run Workflow' dropdown and the green button to run the tests against the master branch
